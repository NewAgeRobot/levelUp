Have showing courses

Need to somehow store the courses that have just been selected and iterate through the table again to find ones tagged with a 1 in the previous options' columns

Maybe run another query on the database?


Have currently opted to save their current three interests into slots on the user table

Next course of action:

! Gather array of courses from the database that match the interests
	-be able to procedurally iterate through them, have them count down (maybe ignore the counter to just get them going?)
		-might have to add a counter in the user table that stores the current number of courses to iterate through(!!!), then it just gets them in incrementing order? Another number to store what slot the user is currently at?
			-This would support returning to the page after exploring elsewhere - can be reset upon new interest selection.

			-Maybe create new table for storing ID/Email/Interest0/Interest1/Interest2/numCourse/currentCourse
				-generate it when they create an account





---------------
currently have the results showing separately, print_r($array[0]['CourseTitle']);

have their position in the amount of courses updating.
Set up so that it shows all the details of the first one
have a button that updates the table with the incremented number then refreshes current page to show the new iteration

figure out how to store the saved courses. New table? just saving their id's? who knows...

Figure out how to shuffle the courses

look at using iframe so whole page doesn't need to be reloaded to view new course
